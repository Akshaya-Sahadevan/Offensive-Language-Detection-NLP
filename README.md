**Offensive Language Identification with Transformers on OLID Dataset**+

Transformer Power! ✨ These revolutionary NLP models ditch sequential processing, analyzing entire sentences at once with their "attention" superpower. This lets them capture deeper word relationships, leading to record-breaking performance in tasks like translation and sentiment analysis. Imagine them as conductors for language, focusing on the most important parts to grasp the meaning in full.
**Why choose this project?** 😃
Respectful Online Communities  Identifying offensive language online is crucial to fostering positive interactions and protecting users from harmful content. The OLID (Offensive language Identification Dataset) dataset is a key resource for training and evaluating models that tackle this challenge. Widely used as a benchmark, it allows researchers to compare the effectiveness of different NLP approaches. The dataset is by "OffensEval is a series of shared tasks on offensive language identification organized at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)"

This repository explores the exciting potential of transformer models in identifying offensive language within the OLID dataset. ⚡️ By attempting this project with OLID dataset, I am trying to increase my understanding on the NLP transformer models.
