# Offensive-Language-Detection-NLP

Transformer models are shaking up NLP! They ditch sequential processing and use attention to analyze entire sentences at once. This superpower lets them capture deep word relationships, leading to record-breaking performance in tasks like translation and sentiment analysis. Think of them as conductors for language, focusing on the most important parts to understand the meaning in full.

Identifying offensive language online is becoming increasingly important for fostering respectful online communities and safeguarding users from harmful content. The OLID dataset is a crucial resource for training and evaluating models that identify offensive language.  Widely used as a benchmark, it allows researchers to compare the effectiveness of different NLP approaches in this critical task. So why not we try some transformer model on the OLID dataset.

The ELECTRA model, known for its masked language modeling with replacement tasks, pushes the boundaries of NLP by achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring massive amounts of labeled data. This repository explores the task of identifying offensive language in OLID using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
